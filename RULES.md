# Repo rules

- Keep each page short and skimmable.
- Prefer exact commands over paragraphs.
- Use the note template:
  **Problem / Fix / Notes / Last updated**
- No secrets (keys, tokens, private IPs, personal info).
- Anything risky must say what it changes + rollback.
- If it belongs in a project repo (Lost Contact / Hawklabs docs), don’t duplicate it here.
