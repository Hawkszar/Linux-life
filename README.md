# Linux-life

A small, practical knowledge base for Linux: setup notes, common fixes, and copy-paste snippets.

Built from real “what broke / how we fixed it” moments.
Scripts + helpful daily tasks to make Linux life… the right life.

## What you’ll find here
- **Tips**: short, focused notes (1 problem → 1 fix)
- **Troubleshooting**: symptom → likely cause → fix
- **Snippets**: copy/paste commands and patterns
- **Scripts**: small tools for repeatable tasks

## Suggested structure
- `tips/` — quick fixes (one file per topic)
- `troubleshooting/` — deeper “symptom → cause → fix”
- `snippets/` — small command patterns
- `scripts/` — bash/python utilities
- `setup/` — install + config notes (Pop!_OS, Ubuntu, etc.)

## Note template (use this format)
**Problem:** what you saw  
**Fix:** exact steps that worked  
**Notes:** surprises / gotchas  
**Last updated:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Repo rules (keeps it clean)
- Keep each page short and skimmable
- Prefer exact commands over paragraphs
- If it belongs in the main Hawklabs project docs, don’t duplicate it here
- Don’t include secrets (keys, tokens, private IPs)
